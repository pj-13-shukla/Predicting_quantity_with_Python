# Predicting_quantity_with_Python
This project revolves around the analysis and prediction of sales quantity based on historical transaction data. The primary goal is to empower business decision-makers with insights into customer purchase behavior and to develop a predictive model that forecasts future sales quantities.

The project begins with the collection and preprocessing of historical sales data, ensuring it contains essential information such as Customer ID, Date, and Quantity. Data pre-processing involves handling missing values, converting dates to a suitable format, and structuring data for analysis.

The analysis phase includes data visualization to gain a better understanding of sales trends over time, customer behavior, and the distribution of quantities. Visualizations encompass histograms, line plots, and box plots, providing actionable insights into sales patterns.

For prediction, a machine learning model is chosen, such as Linear Regression or Random Forest Regression. The selected model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error to assess its performance. Once trained, the model can make predictions for future sales quantities based on Customer ID and Date inputs.

This project holds significant potential for improving inventory management, optimizing marketing strategies, and enhancing customer satisfaction by ensuring the availability of products when and where they are needed most.
